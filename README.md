# TUNED-logisticreg-Norwegian-bonus


This project dives into salary trends for Norwegian developers using R, data science, and machine learning. The goal is to explore what really drives salaries and bonusesâ€”cleaning the data, spotting trends, and building models to find the key factors.


Below is a visualization of the estimated contributions of different factors to receiving a salary bonus, based on a tuned LASSO logistic regression model, final ROCAUC:0.72

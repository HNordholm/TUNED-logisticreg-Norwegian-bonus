# TUNED-logisticreg-Norwegian-bonus


This project explores salary trends for Norwegian developers using R, data science, and machine learning. The goal is to explore what really drives salaries and bonuses by cleaning the data, spotting trends, and build a logistic regression model for bonus factor importance. 


## This analysis is structured as follows:

Data cleansing & prep  

EDA â€“ GGPLOT 

Statistical analysis - correlation plots 

Machine learning - Tuned logistic regression model 


Below is a visualization of the estimated contributions of different factors to receiving a salary bonus, based on a tuned LASSO logistic regression model.
